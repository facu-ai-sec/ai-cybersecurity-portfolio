This folder contains two projects, both of which use deep learning with pre-trained models to detect objects in different environments.



In the first script, image\_detection.py, the MobileNetSSD model is used to identify objects within an AI-generated image, where two airplanes and two cars can be detected.



In the second script, camera\_detection.py, a more complex approach is implemented, as it requires capturing live video from a camera and processing each frame in real time before displaying the output.



The input\_images folder contains the test image used for the first model, while the output\_images folder includes the corresponding detection result.

However, for privacy and professional reasons, the visual output of the second script is not included, and only the source code is provided.
