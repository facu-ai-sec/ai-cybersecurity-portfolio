# Object Detection with Deep Learning (OpenCV)

This folder contains two projects that use deep learning with pre-trained models to perform object detection in different environments using OpenCV.

## Projects Overview

### Image-Based Object Detection

The `image_detection.py` script applies the MobileNetSSD model to a static, AI-generated image.

In this example, the model successfully detects multiple objects, including:
- Two airplanes  
- Two cars  

This script demonstrates the complete workflow for image-based object detection, from loading the model to visualizing detection results.

### Real-Time Camera Object Detection

The `camera_detection.py` script implements a more advanced approach by capturing live video from a camera and processing each frame in real time.

Each frame is passed through the deep learning model, and detected objects are displayed dynamically on the video stream.

For privacy and professional reasons, the visual output of this script is not included in the repository. Only the source code is provided.

## Project Structure

- `image_detection.py` – Object detection on a static image  
- `camera_detection.py` – Real-time object detection using a camera  
- `input_images/` – Test image used for image-based detection  
- `output_images/` – Detection result generated by the model

## Notes

These projects are intended for educational and experimental purposes, showcasing how pre-trained deep learning models can be integrated into computer vision workflows using Python and OpenCV.
