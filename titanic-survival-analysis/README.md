# Titanic Survival Analysis  
### Data Cleaning and Prediction

---

## Overview

This project focuses on data analysis and preprocessing using the classic Titanic dataset.  
The main objective is to clean, transform, and explore the data, and then build a simple predictive model to estimate passenger survival.

The emphasis is placed on correct data handling, clarity, and structure rather than on model optimization.

## Example Workflow

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Handle missing values and categorical variables  
3. Visualize correlations between features  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Train a Logistic Regression model  
6. Evaluate model performance

## Notes

This project is intended as a learning and portfolio piece to demonstrate data analysis and preprocessing skills using Pandas, along with an introductory machine learning model.

The focus is on clarity, structure, and correct handling of data rather than maximizing predictive performance.
