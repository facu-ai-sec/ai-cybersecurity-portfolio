This repository contains a collection of independent Python projects developed for learning, experimentation, and portfolio purposes. The projects cover a range of topics including automation, data analysis, machine learning, computer vision, and basic cybersecurity tools.

All scripts were created as part of my self-directed study while preparing for university programs related to Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Security. Each project focuses on applying theoretical concepts to practical, real-world problems.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate folders, each representing an individual project or experiment. Projects vary in scope and complexity, ranging from small utility scripts to more complete prototypes involving data preprocessing, model training, or system-level interaction.

The contents include, but are not limited to:

- Python automation scripts for file and data processing

- Data analysis and machine learning experiments

- Network and cybersecurity-related tools

- Computer vision prototypes using OpenCV

- Exploratory projects developed while learning new libraries and concepts

- Projects are documented individually within their respective folders when necessary.

Goals

This repository serves as a technical portfolio to demonstrate:

- Practical use of Python 

- Problem-solving and logical structuring of code

- Progressive learning through increasingly complex projects

- Interest in Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity as academic and professional paths

The long-term goal is to pursue higher education abroad and contribute to the development of technology focused on real-world impact and digital security.

Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

- OpenCV

- Requests, sockets, Scapy

- os, shutil and standard libraries

- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

More projects and experiments will continue to be added over time.
