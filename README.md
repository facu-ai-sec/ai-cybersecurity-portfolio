This repository showcases a collection of projects that explore the intersection between Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Python development.
All projects were developed as part of my independent study while preparing for university programs in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Security.

Contents
1. Machine Learning Projects

Malicious Traffic Classifier
Supervised ML model trained on real-world network traffic datasets to distinguish between benign and malicious behaviour.
Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and future deployment pipeline.

Titanic Survival Predictor
A simple Logistic Regression model predicting passenger survival based on demographic and contextual variables.
Focused on understanding data cleaning and binary classification.

2. Cybersecurity Tools

Port Scanner (Python + sockets)
Custom-built scanner capable of detecting open ports and inferring probable services.
Includes exception handling, latency measurement and multi-target support.

(Upcoming) Network Packet Interceptor (Scapy)
A tool for capturing, parsing, and analysing packets in real time.
Designed to integrate with an AI model for anomaly detection.

3. Additional Experiments

Explorations with OpenCV, SVM classifiers, and real-time face recognition.
Small utilities developed while learning Python fundamentals and network programming.


Goals
